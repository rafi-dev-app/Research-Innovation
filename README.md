This research addresses the critical issue of motorcycle accidents in Bangladesh attributed to brake failure by leveraging machine learning techniques for brake pad life prediction. In the absence of a suitable dataset, manual data collection from Bangladeshi bikers was undertaken, yielding a unique dataset of 513 entries with key attributes: user name, bike model, road type, and brake pad life in kilometers. The study aims to contribute to motorcycle safety by developing a predictive model tailored to the Bangladeshi biking industry. Nine regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regression, and XGBoost Regression, were applied and evaluated on their predictive accuracy. Ridge Regression stands out as the best-performing model based on the provided metrics, closely followed by Linear and Lasso Regression with a lower mean squared error (5415839.88) and mean absolute error (1590.70). The R-squared score (0.8119) indicates an improved fit to the data. The dataset's uniqueness lies in its contextual relevance to the Bangladeshi biking industry, providing valuable insights into factors influencing brake pad deterioration. The research aims to achieve a predictive accuracy exceeding 80%, a threshold crucial for practical applicability and its potential to reduce motorcycle accidents. The abstract underscores the importance of this research in addressing a serious road safety concern in Bangladesh. The findings contribute to the literature on brake pad wear prediction, with implications for the formulation of targeted safety measures and policies. The comprehensive analysis of diverse regression algorithms and the unique dataset offer a foundation for future research and enhancements in motorcycle safety systems.
